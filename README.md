# 8 bit 74 Series Computer

This is a project to make a basic but fully functional 8 bit computer using microchips from the 74LS series.

Enormous credit is due to Ben Eater (https://eater.net/) whose simply excellent series of YouTube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) inspired and informed this project.
