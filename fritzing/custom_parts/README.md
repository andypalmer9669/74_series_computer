This is a copy of the Fritzing folder that Fritzing creates in the user home area (C:\Users\Andy\Documents\Fritzing in my case on Windows).

It's primarily a backup for the custom parts used in the design stage, but feel free to try and modify the files (bins/my_parts.fzb seems to be the one to edit) if you would like to copy them for use in your own project.
