8-bit 74 Series Computer
========================

Welcome to the documentation for my 8-bit 74 Series Computer project! 

I have to start by saying a huge thank you to the people, sortware and websites that informed and inspired this project. See the :doc:`resources` page for a full listing.

If you would like to get the most out of this documentation please see the :doc:`resources` page for links to the resources I used (especially the videos by Ben Eater and James Bates). I've tried to only document things not covered elsewhere and point to the existing resources were available.

The source for any code used (and these docs) is available in the `GitHub repository`_.
