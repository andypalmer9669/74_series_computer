Design
======

This section covers the design, structure and operating principles of the computer. 

I've tried to keep this implementation independent but there are some places where specifics come through (buffers on bus lines for example). This was mostly to serve as a reminder for when I was buidling the computer (details in the :doc:`hardware` section).
