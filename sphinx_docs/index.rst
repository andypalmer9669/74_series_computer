8-bit 74LS Computer
===================

Welcome to the documentation for my 8-bit 74LS Computer project! 

I have to start by saying a huge thank you to `Ben Eater` whose simply excellent series of `YouTube videos`_  inspired and informed this project. Please watch his series of videos first as he has done a brilliant job of explaining eveything which I have mostly just implemented and extended a little.
